# CS302-Python-2020-Group33 - Object Classification #

The purpose of this project is to create an object recogniser with the help of pytorch models. 

## Motivation ##

Images can contain a large variety of objects, which can range anywhere from humans to cars. These objects can be recognised 
and classified through the use of artificial intelligence. The purpose of this object recogniser is to provide people of the
public with a tool that is easily able to recognise different objects in an image, regardless of their location in the image.

## What Does It Do? ##
This project is able to recognise objects in an image through the use of pytorch models. The models available in this project 
are; AlexNet, DenseNet, ResNet and VGG. Using the main file provided, either of these models can be passed through and used 
in order to train and test the object recognition. 

## Testing Environment ##
The models presented in this project were tested out on two seperate environments. The results highlighted here have been 
obtained in these environments. The details for the testing environments 
are listed below. <br />
### Environment 1: <br />
CPU: Intel(R) Core(™) i7 1.8GHz <br />
GPU: Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620 <br />
Memory: 8.0 GB <br />
IDE: Pycharm <br />
### Environment 2: <br />
CPU: Intel(R) Core(™) i5 1.8GHz <br />
GPU: Intel HD Graphics 6000 1536 MB <br />
Memory: 8.0 GB <br />
IDE: Pycharm <br />
